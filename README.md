------

*BotBarbello is a fitness bot that would be the best buddy of any guy aspiring to be a bodybuilder!*
He is a Slackbot programmed with Sinatra, a Ruby framework and works by retrieving data from a PostgreSQL database deployed on Heroku. Here are the cool things he can do!

- He recognizes your greeting when you say Hi or Hey and responds with an introductory message and tips on the lingo he understands and a Start Workout button which enables a streamlined workout video category selection process.
- He also lets you choose the category of the workout video category that you would like by simply typing start, then clicking the Start Workout button and then clicking on the buttons that follow to choose a workout category in order to be given a brand new workout video belonging to that category.
- He motivates you everyday with an automatically posted quote from one of the famous body builders Arnold Swarzenegger, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Mohammed Ali, Mike Tyson and Sylvester Stallone.
- You can get inspiration on demand by asking to see before and after photos and a story of body transformation of famous bodybuilders by simply typing /beforeafter.
- He also allows you to ask for a quote from a specific bodybuilder by simply typing /inspire arnold, /inspire ali, /inspire rock, /inspire stallone or /inspire tyson.
- He enables you to ask for a random workout video by simply typing /workout.
- He also let you ask for a specific workout video on cardio, dumbbell or barbell by typing /workout cardio, /workout dumbbell or /workout barbell.
- Even better, he is also smart enough to understand keywords like shoulders, chest, back, abs, arms, legs, glutes, HIIT, Pilates, Yoga, Tai Chi and Aerobics in addition to barbell, dumbbell, kettle bell, stability ball and medicine ball.
- And if you're ever stuck, all you need to do is type help and he will get back to you instantly with helpful tips on the lingo he understands.
- BotBarbello will very soon be available on the Slack App Directory!
